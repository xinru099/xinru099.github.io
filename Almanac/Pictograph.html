     <h1>Pictograph </h1>
     <div class="content">
        <p>Pictographs are one of the earliest ways for ancient humans to communicate and record information. Human used simple signs to show things like weathers, animals and actions. Unlike modern alphabets,  pictographs just like what they look like. For example, a picture of circle might meant the sun. These images helped people share information before written languages existed at that time. Meanwhile, because ancient humans could make tools, such as earthenware jars and vessels, pictographs can be used as decorative patterns used on them. I understand pictographs as a bridge to connect drawing and writing,  where signs were not just have visual meaning but have communicative significance that people can understand. In modern society, the essence of many design signs is also an evolution of pictograms.

        In my chosen images, I first collected examples of ancient rock art , Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Chinese oracle bone script. These show how pictographs were used across different cultures. The rock paintings show early humans recording hunting scenes and their daily life. The Egyptian symbols are more organized, combing meaning with religious and royal functions. The oracle bones from ancient China use the pictographs for divination and decision-making. Many modern scripts, like Chinese characters, still show traces of their pictographic roots. Even though we do not draw animals or tools to write now, the connection between shape and meaning still exists in design and language. These images prove that pictographs can  play a role beyond their own visual symbols.

       <p>In the modern days,  pictographs have been transformed into visual identifiers and are often used as signs in public places. For instance, the men’s and women’s signs in toilets are one of the classic examples.  Meanwhile, emojis can also be regarded as pictographic symbols for expressing emotions in social medial. People use them instead of words or sentences to express emotions or ideas.</p>

        These visual systems all rely on the idea that meaning can come from shape. A pictograph does not need to be realistic, but it must be recognizable. The viewer needs to look at  them and connect with an idea or object in the mind. When people are doing these, the pictographs will be more special——they can communicate something without needing full sentences. With the development of the society, pictographs became more and more structured and organized through modern design. They moved from simple drawings to more fixed forms with rules. This transformation enabled pictographs to go global.

       <p>Durscheid and Meletis (2019) explain that pictographs played an important role in the move from pictures to writing. They say pictographs are more than just drawings — they helped people turn visual signs into something closer to written language. I think this matches my understanding. These images show how people slowly moved from using pictures to creating systems of writing. Pictographs are part of the beginning of human visual language — they remind us that communication can exist without words.
