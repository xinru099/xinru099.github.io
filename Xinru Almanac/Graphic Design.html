     <h1>Graphic Design </h1>
     <div class="content">
        <p>Graphic design is one of the main branches in the field of design which is a broad area. It is the practice of combining text, images and layout to communicate messages visually. Usually, we can see graphic design in posters, advertisements, books, websites and many other formats. It appears in our daily life and cover many aspects. I understand it as more than decoration, it is a tool to let people can solve many problems, like visual problem-solving. Graphic designers use  fonts, colours and layout to guide people how to read and understand information. It can not only let people know the information quickly and clearly, but also enable people to have a beautiful visual experience. Overall, the power of graphic design is not just about how it looks, but how it works.
        </p>  

        <p>In my image collection, I find two posters——one used graphic and one focused typography, an information design about subway route, a brand identity system and a layout grid. Firstly, the typography poster shows how letters can become both messages and images and the graphic poster showcases the multiple information experiences that simple graphics bring to people. Secondly, the subway map shows how design ensures legibility in a fast-paced environment. It show us the information quickly and clearly by using colour contrast and regular lines. Thirdly is the brand system which includes a logo, colour palette and design rules. All of these details ensure visual consistency. The last one is the grid system image. It shows us how structure helps align content and create visual balance.
        </p> 

        <p>In my opinion although these images are expressed in different forms in graphic design,  there is one common point——the importance of layout, like how we appropriate use the colour or font. For example,a serif font might suggest tradition or elegance  while a bold sans-serif feels modern. In the other poster, only typeface can be used as visuals. They were arranged by size, weight, and position to create rhythm and tension. This shows only typography can also become the main visual element.  In addition, the Information design , like the station map, is a typical example that how designer can simplify complex things. It requires graphic designers to have the ability to grasp the characteristics of things, especially when they are in real-word,  and this ability can also be applied to other design directions.

       <p>Danesi (2016) discusses how modern visual systems, like graphic design, act as structured codes that guide how we understand meaning in everyday life. This supports my understanding. A good design system doesn’t just decorate—it helps people understand signs, brands, or content. Graphic design translates abstract ideas into visuals that are easy to read, feel, and act on. It combines beauty and clarity, making complex things simple to see.
